## 🌟 Overview

SecureID is a proof-of-concept authentication platform inspired by Sweden's BankID, adapted for the Bahraini banking sector. The platform replaces outdated password and SMS-based systems with quantum-resistant, biometric-powered digital identity verification.

### Problem Statement

- Traditional banking authentication methods are fundamentally broken
- Password breaches affect 80% of cybersecurity incidents
- SMS 2FA can be bypassed through SIM swapping (rising 400% since 2020)
- Current systems create friction that drives customers to less secure alternatives

### Solution

SecureID provides:

- **Zero-Knowledge Cryptographic Architecture**: Device-bound private keys with biometric locks
- **Real-time Risk Assessment**: ML-powered behavioral analysis detecting anomalies
- **Cross-Bank Single Sign-On**: Universal secure identity across Bahraini financial institutions
- **QR Code Transaction Authorization**: Secure, contactless authentication for high-value transactions

2. KYC verification (simulated)
3. Profile completion (if needed)
4. Full dashboard access

### 2. QR Code Authentication

**Service Provider Simulator**

- Generate QR codes for transaction authorization
- Display transaction details (amount, merchant, etc.)
- Real-time status updates

**User Scanner Simulator**

- Scan QR codes for authentication
- Review transaction details
- Approve/reject transactions

### 3. Native App Integration

**Banking App Simulation**

- Full identity verification required
- Complete user data sharing
- Regulatory compliance focused

**Social Media App Simulation**

- Anonymous login option available
- Privacy-preserving data sharing

  "id_number": "123456789"
}
```

**Response:**

```json

// ID number validation
const SIdNumber = z
  .string()
  .regex(/^\d{9}$/, 'Must be 9-digit Bahraini ID number')
```
